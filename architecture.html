            <p class="descriptions">At my highschool we had the chance to take an Architecture class. In that class the final project was to design a open air pavillion. The project had a few restriction. Some being that there could be no more than one wall in the structure, it had to have a roof and it had to be wheelchair accesable. My design skewed those restrictions a bit but I was happy with how creative the idea was. In total the model took me about 15 hours to make and I was super proud of the end result.</p>
