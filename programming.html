        <p class="descriptions">I have a little bit of programming experience, mostly in Javascript. I took a class over my junior year summer in high school that taught me how to program in Java. Along with 4 other students we designed and programmed our own website for the class. Our website was a simple college recommender that would spit out a college based on user inputed preferences. I also programmed a simple passion project which was a clone of a popular basketball online trivia game. Sadly both of these dont work anymore as I have to renew the APIs.   </p>
