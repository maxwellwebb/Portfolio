        <p class="descriptions">I have a little bit of programming experience, mostly in Javascript and html. I took a class over my junior year summer in high school that taught me how to program, and in that class we were also tasked with designing our own website. Our website was a simple college recommender that would spit out a college based on user inputed preferences. I mostly programmed the system that would communicate with an api to spit out recomendatoins based on user inputs. I have also programmed a simple passion project which was a clone of a popular basketball online trivia game. Sadly both of these dont work anymore as I have to renew the APIs.</p>
